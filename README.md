# SP35
Evm - solana benchmark experimentation

The goal of this experiment is to use AI to benchmark and test porting of smart contract codebase across chains 

### Benchmark
Accuracy in code translation at least > 90% 

Models 
- Codellama
- Claude Sonnet 3.5 and 3.7
- Gemini
- Openai

## First Iteration Major goal 

Can we go from 
EVM <-> BTC Contract chains ( Rootstock) 
EVM <-> Solana ( SPL ) 


Migrate low context and high end projects 

## Existing 

- Neon EVM ( solana) 

This project will be exported to IRV3 Collective ( An Open collective)
